/*
 * Exercise 2: (1) Following the HelloDate.java example in this chapter, 
 * create a “hello, world” program that simply displays that statement. 
 * You need only a single method in your class (the “main” one that gets executed when the program starts). 
 * Remember to make it static and to include the argument list, even though you don’t use the argument list. 
 * Compile the program with javac and run it using java. 
 * If you are using a different development environment than the JDK, learn how to compile and run programs in that environment.
